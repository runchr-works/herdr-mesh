# herdr-mesh

An MCP server for orchestrating multi-agent workflows inside [herdr](https://herdr.dev),
enabling real-time communication, pane management, and contextual handoffs.

> 한국어: [README.ko.md](./README.ko.md)

## Why this exists

herdr already has everything needed to orchestrate multiple agents — real panes,
persistent sessions, semantic agent state (idle/working/blocked/done), and a CLI +
socket API to drive it all. What it lacked was a **standard interface for agents
themselves to use it.**

So when you run several agents inside herdr (Claude, Codex, …), there was no clean
way for them to read each other's context, share a session, or pass messages
without a human shuffling between terminals.

herdr-mesh closes that gap: it exposes herdr's CLI as **MCP tools**, so any
MCP-capable agent — regardless of type — can read other agents' panes, hand off
context, coordinate, and spawn new agents **on its own, from plain-language
instructions.** The goal is to make herdr's multi-agent workflow programmable by
the agents themselves, through one standard, agent-agnostic interface.

## Use cases

Concrete situations where herdr-mesh turns tedious terminal-shuffling into a
single natural-language instruction.

### 1. Code → review → fix loop

You have Claude writing code and Codex reviewing it. Codex finds a bug — normally
you'd copy it over to Claude by hand. Instead:

> "Have Codex review the changes Claude just made. If it finds problems, send them
> to Claude to fix, then ask Codex to re-review. Repeat until it's clean."

The orchestrating agent uses `herdr_agent_read` (pull Codex's review) →
`herdr_agent_send` (hand the findings to Claude) → `herdr_agent_wait` (let Claude
finish) → and loops the review. No copy-paste between panes.

### 2. Parallel fan-out

> "Split this refactor: have Claude do the API layer and Codex do the tests, then
> collect both results and summarize."

Spawns/targets two agents with `herdr_agent_start` / `herdr_agent_send`, waits on
each with `herdr_agent_wait`, and merges their output with `herdr_agent_read`.

### 3. Long-running handback

> "Tell the build agent to run the full test suite, wait until it prints PASS or
> FAIL, and bring me the failing cases."

Uses `herdr_pane_run` to kick off the run and `herdr_wait_output` to block on the
result — so you're notified the moment it's done instead of babysitting the pane.

### 4. Unblock a stuck agent

An agent is sitting at a prompt waiting for confirmation (`blocked`) while you're
heads-down in another pane.

> "Is any agent blocked waiting on input? If Codex is stuck on a y/n prompt,
> approve it so it can continue."

`herdr_agent_list` surfaces the `blocked` state; `herdr_agent_send` +
`herdr_pane_send_keys` answer the prompt — no context-switch on your part.

### 5. Spec → implement → verify pipeline

> "Take the plan in the *architect* agent's pane, give it to Claude to implement,
> then have the *tester* agent run the suite against the result."

Reads the spec with `herdr_agent_read`, hands it off with `herdr_agent_send`,
waits with `herdr_agent_wait`, then triggers verification in a third agent — a
three-stage relay driven by one instruction.

### 6. Route a question to the agent that has the context

> "The agent working in the payments service already has that code loaded — ask it
> why the webhook retries, and bring me its answer."

Instead of re-loading context yourself, `herdr_agent_send` poses the question to
the agent already sitting in that codebase and `herdr_agent_read` returns its
reply.

The point: the agent-to-agent handoffs that used to need a human in the middle
become one sentence.

herdr already exposes its workspace/agent runtime over a CLI + socket API. `herdr-mesh`
wraps that CLI as [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools, so any
MCP client can read other agents' panes, send messages, share sessions, and spawn new
agents through a standard interface.

It is **agent-agnostic**: tools operate on whatever agents herdr recognizes — `pi`, `omp`,
`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `hermes`, `qodercli`, and any future integration. Targets
accept a terminal id, agent name, reported agent label, or legacy pane id; nothing is tied
to a specific agent type. Use `herdr_integration_status` to see what's available.

## How it works

```
MCP client ──stdio(MCP)──> herdr-mesh ──exec "herdr …"──> herdr CLI ──socket──> herdr server
```

Each tool runs the `herdr` CLI as a subprocess and returns its JSON output. No separate
protocol implementation — herdr's own version/protocol handling stays authoritative.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- [herdr](https://herdr.dev) installed and a server running (`herdr status` shows `running`).
  Set `HERDR_BIN` if `herdr` is not on `PATH`.

## Install (recommended)

Install globally, then let the built-in installer detect your agents and register
herdr-mesh with them:

```bash
npm i -g runchr-works/herdr-mesh
herdr-mesh install
```

> Installed straight from GitHub (not the npm registry). npm clones the repo and
> its `prepare` script builds it on install, so you need `git`, network access,
> and a Node toolchain. To update later, re-run the same `npm i -g` command.

`herdr-mesh install` detects installed agents and registers herdr-mesh with the
ones you pick:

- **Claude Code** — via `claude mcp add -s user`
- **Codex** — adds `[mcp_servers.herdr-mesh]` to `~/.codex/config.toml`
- **opencode** — merges into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- Other agents — prints the exact config snippet to paste

It is **safe**: existing config is parsed and merged (never overwritten), a `.bak`
backup is made before writing, and re-running skips agents already registered.
Use `herdr-mesh install -y` to register with all detected agents non-interactively.

Restart the agent(s) afterward so they pick up herdr-mesh.

## Manual registration

Each agent is its own MCP client; register herdr-mesh once per agent. All agents
on the same machine share the same herdr socket, so they can see and message each
other. The server command is `herdr-mesh` (after a global install).

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user herdr-mesh herdr-mesh
```

Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.herdr-mesh]
command = "herdr-mesh"
```

Generic MCP config (stdio):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "herdr-mesh": {
      "command": "herdr-mesh"
    }
  }
}
```

> Prefer not to install globally? Use `npx -y runchr-works/herdr-mesh` as the
> command instead of `herdr-mesh` (npx builds it from GitHub on first run; slower
> cold start).

## Build from source (local development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runchr-works/herdr-mesh.git
cd herdr-mesh
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js          # run the server directly
node dist/index.js install  # or run the installer from source
```

## Usage — just talk to your agent

You don't type tool names. Talk to your agent (Claude, Codex, …) in plain
language; it decides when to call a herdr-mesh tool and reports back. The phrases
below are examples of what to say and which capability they trigger.

**See what's running**
- "What agents are running in herdr right now?" → lists agents + status
- "Which agent integrations does herdr support?" → integration status

**Read another agent's context (handoff in)**
- "Read the codex pane and summarize what it's working on."
- "Grab the last 100 lines from the agent named *reviewer*."

**Send a message / hand off work**
- "Tell codex: 'please review the diff on this branch'."
- "Ask the *reviewer* agent to run the tests and report back."
- "Send `npm test` to pane w65343…-3 and run it." (executes with Enter)

**Coordinate / wait**
- "Wait until codex is idle, then send it the next task."
- "Watch the build pane and tell me when it prints 'BUILD SUCCESS'."

**Spawn / manage agents**
- "Start a new codex agent in a split to the right and have it review my work."
- "Open a new agent named *tester* running claude."

**Sessions & workspace**
- "List herdr sessions." / "Create a new workspace for the docs project."

A typical handoff, all from natural language:

> "Take my current changes, hand them to a fresh codex agent for review, wait
> for it to finish, then summarize its feedback for me."

The agent chains `herdr_agent_start` → `herdr_agent_send` → `herdr_agent_wait` →
`herdr_agent_read` on its own.

**Good to know when phrasing requests**
- Be explicit about whether you want a message just *delivered* vs *run/submitted*
  — e.g. "just type it for them" vs "send it and run it". (Delivery only types
  text into the other agent's input; it does not press Enter.)
- If output looks empty, ask for it "based on what's **on screen** now". The
  "recent command output" region can be empty when nothing has been tracked.

## Tools (reference for the LLM)

These are the tool names exposed to the agent — listed here for reference, not for
you to type.

**Agent messaging & context (core)**
- `herdr_relay` — deliver a message to an agent **and submit it** (types + Enter).
  Preferred for messaging; avoids the "typed but never submitted" pitfall.
- `herdr_handoff` — send a task, wait for the agent to finish, and read its result
  back — in one step. Preferred for review/fix/verify loops so the chain can't break.
- `herdr_agent_list` — list agents with state (idle/working/blocked/done)
- `herdr_agent_get` — agent details
- `herdr_agent_read` — read another agent's pane output (context handoff)
- `herdr_agent_send` — low-level: type literal text to an agent (no Enter)
- `herdr_agent_wait` — block until an agent reaches a status
- `herdr_wait_output` — block until a pane's output matches text/regex

**Agent lifecycle & discovery**
- `herdr_agent_start` — spawn a new agent terminal (any supported agent)
- `herdr_agent_rename`, `herdr_agent_focus`
- `herdr_integration_status` — list agent integrations herdr knows about and their status

**Sessions**
- `herdr_session_list`, `herdr_session_stop`, `herdr_session_delete`

**Panes**
- `herdr_pane_list` / `get` / `read` / `split` / `run` / `send_text` / `send_keys` / `close` / `rename`
- Use `herdr_pane_run` to type a command **and** press Enter; use `*_send_text` for literal text.

**Tabs & workspaces**
- `herdr_tab_*` — list / create / get / focus / rename / close
- `herdr_workspace_*` — list / create / get / focus / rename / close

## Behavior notes (for the LLM / developers)

Tool-level behavior details — not end-user tips, but what the LLM relies on to
use the tools correctly and what developers should understand.

- **Sending messages / commands**
  - Deliver text only: `herdr_agent_send` (does not press Enter)
  - Also submit it: follow with `herdr_pane_send_keys` sending `enter`
  - Run a shell command: `herdr_pane_run` (types **and** presses Enter) — simplest
- **Reading output**: for context retrieval, `source: "visible"` most reliably
  returns on-screen content. `recent` / `recent-unwrapped` can be empty when there
  is no tracked command-output region.

## Context & session sharing

- **Context sharing**: pull another agent's output with `herdr_agent_read`, push to
  it with `herdr_agent_send` / `herdr_pane_run`.
- **Sessions**: all agents attached to the same herdr server already share one
  session (socket) — that's the foundation context sharing relies on. Over MCP you
  can observe/manage sessions (`session_list` / `stop` / `delete`). Human remote
  `session attach` (SSH attach) is a native herdr feature and interactive, so it is
  intentionally excluded from the MCP tools.

## Troubleshooting

Natural-language requests usually work, but the agent (an LLM) ultimately decides
whether and how to call the tools, so it isn't 100% deterministic. If something
doesn't happen:

- **The agent answered without acting.** Be explicit: name the capability, e.g.
  "use herdr-mesh to message codex" or "call the herdr tools to do this".
- **A message was sent but nothing ran.** `herdr_agent_send` types without Enter.
  Ask to "send it **and run it**", or rely on `herdr_relay` / `herdr_handoff`,
  which submit for you.
- **Wrong or missing target.** Tell it to "list the agents first", then refer to
  one by the name/id from that list.
- **Read came back empty.** Ask for output "from what's **on screen** now"
  (`source: visible`); tracked "recent" output can be empty.
- **A multi-step handoff stalled midway.** Use `herdr_handoff` (send + wait + read
  in one tool) instead of asking the agent to chain several calls itself.
- **Tools not available at all.** Check the server is connected: `claude mcp list`
  or `/mcp` inside the session. Confirm herdr is up with `herdr status`.
- **Still stuck?** Errors are returned verbatim from herdr, so ask the agent to
  "show the exact error it got" — it usually names the cause (e.g. `agent_not_found`).
